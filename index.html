              Knowing what you like in bed can prove challenging, but all it takes is some experimenting to sort out what you prefer! Sooner or later, you’ll realize whether that thing is dick or balls. Those are really the only two options! Here’s how to tell if you are more of a dick girl or more of a balls girl.
              <br><br>
              Think about your partner. If you could only touch one   thing, what would it be?
              <br><br>
              Definitely dick. No question. I love touching that hunk of meat that lives inside those tight boxer briefs all day. Yum!
              How is this even a question? It’s balls all the way. I daydream about grabbing a fistful of those fleshy danglers! Ugh, now I’m horny!
              I would probably touch his back! I do not understand A or B!

              Is there any better way to ring in the holidays than by cozying up in your sturdiest sweatpants and watching some holiday films? There are so many classics filled with memorable quotes, heartwarming stories, and the magic of the season. But sometimes, what you really want for Christmas is to stare at a bunch of very attractive people who are wearing outerwear. Thankfully, Netflix totally gets that, so they released a whole slew of new holiday flicks that are basically just hot people wearing coats. So don’t hold back – dive right into this winter wonderland of ridiculously symmetrical humans dressed for chilly temperatures!

              The Holiday Calendar

              This movie features the devastatingly gorgeous Kat Graham walking around a small town in a peacoat with leather sleeves. Watch her look amazing as she receives a vaguely magical advent calendar, sort of searches for love, and kind of advances her career. Enjoy looking at the flawless skin and sparkly smiles of both of her romantic interests – the cute nice guy in a fun puffy coat AND the cute mean guy in a stiff wool coat. And, as a special Christmas treat, feast your eyes on Ron Cephas Jones as the handsome grandpa, absolutely destroying in tweed!
